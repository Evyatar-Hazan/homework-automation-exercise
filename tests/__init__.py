"""
Tests Package
=============

Test cases and fixtures.

Users should create test files here following the pattern in test_ebay_example.py:

1. Create fixtures for setup/teardown
2. Configure logging at session level
3. Write business-focused tests
4. Use Page Objects (not Playwright directly)
5. Keep assertions simple and clear
