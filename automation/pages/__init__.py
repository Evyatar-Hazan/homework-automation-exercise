"""
Pages Package
=============

Page Object definitions.

Users should create their own page objects here, following the pattern
demonstrated in ebay_example.py:

1. Inherit from BasePage
2. Define UI elements as SmartLocators (with fallbacks)
3. Implement high-level business methods
4. Never use Playwright directly
5. Never hardcode selectors outside this file
